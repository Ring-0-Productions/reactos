 * Removes a cell from a fast key index.
 *
 * @param[in,out] FastIndex
 * The fast key index where a cell has to be removed.
 *

 * The index which points to the location of the
 * cell that is to be removed.
 *
 * @param[in] UpdateCount
 * If set to TRUE, the function will update the fast
 * index count accordingly by one value less. If set
 * to FALSE, the count won't be updated. See Remarks
 * for further information.

 *
 * @remarks
 * In case where the fast index count is not updated is
 * when the key index is not a root but a leaf. In such
 * scenario such leaf is the actual key index itself
 * so updating the fast index count is not necessary (aka
 * UpdateCount is set to FALSE).
